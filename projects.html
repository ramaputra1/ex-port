      <p>
        Aloha! <br />
        Some of my projects are still in progress, but I have one that is
        finished, it is a modified style of BYU Hawaii, it has different colors,
        icons and logos. But i can't post it because I do not want to get any
        violating copyright, but my purpose of making it is just for practice,
        if you want to see it please contact me, I will show you. I made this
        modification purely for practice especially layouting Web Design, I
        don't post it anywhere, I really respected the copyright of things.
